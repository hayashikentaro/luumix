# Metadata Schema v1

Metadata v1 separates generated analysis, AI review, manual overrides, and effective playback metadata.

The TypeScript source of truth is:

```text
packages/metadata/src/types.ts
```

The effective resolution implementation is:

```text
packages/metadata/src/resolve.ts
```

## Layers

- `analysis`: deterministic or MIR-oriented observations, candidates, risk signals, and analysis defaults.
- `aiReview`: schema-bound candidate selections and auto-mix risk judgment from structured analysis data.
- `manualOverrides`: user corrections that must win over machine and AI selections.
- `effective`: resolved metadata consumed by playback.

Resolution precedence:

```text
manualOverrides > aiReview > analysis.defaults
```

## Candidate Scope

Schema v1 can represent:

- source file identity and cached content hash
- low-level feature summaries
- tempo candidates, including half/double alternatives
- beat grid candidates
- 4/4 downbeat phase candidates
- structure candidates
- mix-in, mix-out, and avoid transition candidates
- risk signals and auto-mix rejection

It intentionally does not implement real audio analysis yet.

## Fixtures

Sample metadata fixtures are synthetic and illustrative:

```text
fixtures/metadata/simple-124bpm.analysis.json
fixtures/metadata/simple-124bpm.effective.json
```

Do not commit private library metadata or copyrighted audio fixtures.
